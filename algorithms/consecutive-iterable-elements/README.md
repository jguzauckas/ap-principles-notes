This repository is designed to show you some techniques for checking consecutive elements in iterables. There are two methods provided here. It is expected that everyone goes through and completes the `easy` method (note it is not easy, but is easier than the `advanced`). Students that are looking for a challenge may check out and work on `advanced` only after working through `easy`.
